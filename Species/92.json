According to the data, C. uraceonemoralis is widely distributed in Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Sweden). An identical sequence from an ectomycorrhizal root tip in public databases from Iran (FR852021) is existed.","GlebaText":"","SporesText":"","MicroscopicText":"","CapText":"","GillsText":"","StalkText":"","FleshText":"","PresenceText":"","EndangermentText":"","ProtectionValueText":"","EdibilityText":"","SimilarSpeciesText":"","SourceText":"","CommentText":"Megjegyz\u00E9s:\r\n*A faj neve nem szerepel a Magyar Mikol\u00F3giai T\u00E1rsas\u00E1g gomban\u00E9vjegyz\u00E9k\u00E9ben (2017.04.26).
